# Dylan's Advent of Code

This holds my attempts at Advent of Code solutions.
The solutions will mostly be in C++ and Python for practicing.
Building and running instructions to come later.

## Rules

My own rules are to first solve a problem with the use of as many standard library and Boost features as I see fit.

## To DO

- [ ] Improve CMake build types
- [ ] Figure out how to debug
- [ ] Create top-level `include` and `src` directories with years under it
- [ ] Create script to compare outputs of each version

## Progress

Days are deleted once completed & verified.
This includes both versions.

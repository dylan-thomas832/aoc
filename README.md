# Dylan's Advent of Code

This holds my attempts at Advent of Code solutions.
The solutions will mostly be in C++ and Python for practicing.
Building and running instructions to come later.

## Rules

My own rules are to first solve a problem with the use of as many standard library and Boost features as I see fit.
Then, I will try to solve the problem with my own data structures and algorithms.
For the second part, I can still use standard library features for IO, STL, containers, and math.
